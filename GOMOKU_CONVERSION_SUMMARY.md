# Gomoku Conversion Summary

## Overview
Successfully converted the Landlords card game server-client project to a Gomoku (Five-in-a-Row) game while preserving the underlying Netty-based architecture and event-driven communication system.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Enums Updated for Gomoku

**ServerEventCode.java**
- Replaced landlord-specific events with Gomoku events
- Added: `CODE_GAME_MOVE`, `CODE_GAME_RESET`
- Removed: `CODE_GAME_LANDLORD_ELECT`, `CODE_GAME_POKER_PLAY*`

**ClientEventCode.java** 
- Updated with Gomoku-specific client events
- Added: `CODE_GAME_MOVE_SUCCESS`, `CODE_GAME_MOVE_INVALID`, `CODE_GAME_WIN`, `CODE_GAME_LOSE`, `CODE_GAME_DRAW`
- Replaced: `CODE_SHOW_POKERS` → `CODE_SHOW_BOARD`

**SellType.java → PieceType.java**
- Complete replacement for Gomoku pieces
- Enum values: `EMPTY`, `BLACK`, `WHITE`

**New GameResult.java**
- Enum for game outcomes: `BLACK_WIN`, `WHITE_WIN`, `DRAW`, `IN_PROGRESS`

**ClientRole.java**
- Added: `BLACK_PLAYER`, `WHITE_PLAYER`

### 2. New Game Entities

**Board.java**
- 15x15 game board implementation
- Win detection for 5-in-a-row (horizontal, vertical, diagonal)
- Move validation and game state management

**GameMove.java**
- Represents a single move with position, piece type, and player ID
- Timestamp tracking for move history

**Room.java Updates**
- Removed landlord/poker-specific fields
- Added: `gameBoard`, `blackPlayerId`, `whitePlayerId`, `currentTurn`, `moveHistory`
- Added game management methods: `switchTurn()`, `resetGame()`, `isPlayerTurn()`

**ClientSide.java Updates**
- Removed poker-specific fields (`pokers`)
- Simplified for Gomoku gameplay

### 3. Game Logic Implementation

**GomokuHelper.java**
- Core game logic utilities
- Move validation and execution
- Board display formatting
- Move history formatting
- Win condition checking

**GomokuAI.java**
- Three difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- Strategic move evaluation
- Threat detection and blocking
- Position scoring system

### 4. Documentation Updates

**README.md**
- Updated title and description for Gomoku
- New gameplay rules and commands
- Board position format (row,col)
- Game commands: board, history, reset, pass, exit

**PROTOCO_CN.md** 
- Updated from Landlords to Gomoku terminology
- Protocol documentation updated for game moves

**messages_zh_CN.properties**
- Added Gomoku-specific messages
- Move validation error messages
- Game result messages

### 5. Testing

**GomokuHelperTest.java**
- Comprehensive unit tests for game logic
- Tests for win conditions, move validation, turn management
- Board formatting and game reset functionality

## Architecture Preserved

### Network Layer

- 15x15 board with standard Gomoku rules
- Turn-based gameplay (Black moves first)
- Win condition: 5 pieces in a row
- Real-time move validation

### AI Support  
- Three difficulty levels
- Strategic positioning algorithms
- Threat detection and blocking

### User Experience
- Command-line interface preserved
- Board visualization
- Move history tracking
- Real-time game state updates

### Multiplayer Features

- Spectator mode
- Player rankings and statistics

## Technical Implementation

### Game Board
- 2D array representation (15x15)
- Efficient win detection algorithms
- Move validation with bounds checking

### Turn Management
- Player role assignment (Black/White)
- Turn switching logic
- Game state tracking

### Communication Protocol
- Event-based messaging
- JSON data structures for game state
- Protobuf serialization for network efficiency

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Advanced AI algorithms (minimax with alpha-beta pruning)
- Tournament mode support
- Replay system
- Enhanced ranking system
- Move undo functionality
- Time limits per move

### Technical Improvements
- Performance optimizations for large-scale deployment
- Database integration for persistent game history
- Web-based client interface
- Mobile app support

## Conclusion

The conversion successfully transforms the Landlords game into a fully functional Gomoku game while maintaining the robust networking architecture and event-driven design patterns. The modular structure allows for easy extension and customization, making it suitable for both casual play and competitive gaming scenarios.
